# bamazon-app

This app was created as an introduction to MySQL. 

The program is a dummy version of amazon. The customer is given a list of products for sale. The program will then ask them to choose an item based off of it's product ID. It should then perform a check to make sure the ID is a valid ID. After, the program will ask the customer how many of x item they want to buy and then perform a check against the db to make sure that there is enough in stock. The db should update to reflect the new values after the purchase has been made.
